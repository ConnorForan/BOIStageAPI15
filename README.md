DOCUMENTATION AT THE TOP OF MAIN.LUA

#### If you're using the workshop version:
Before following the steps below, unzip the contents of basementrenovator/scripts into your basementrenovator folder

## Generating Lua Rooms
  - Drag an stb file generated by the official room editor or Basement Renovator onto `basementrenovator/convertstb.bat`
  - Next to the original stb file will be a matching lua file
  - You can use the provided python script to restore an xml copy of the lua file if the original file is lost

## Integration with Basement Renovator
  - In Basement Renovator, add `basementrenovator/convertstb.bat` to your save hook list
    - When you save, lua rooms will automatically be generated alongside the file
  - Add `basementrenovator/testhook.bat` to your test hook list
    - When you test a room, StageAPI will automatically kick in to set up custom grid and meta entities
    - Custom Stage support is not ready yet
